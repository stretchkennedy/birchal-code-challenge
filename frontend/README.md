Your task is to update the recent campaigns section of our site to display the campaign data as tiles, fetching the data from `/campaigns.json`

The designer has prepared the following reference for how the site should look:

Notes:
* The colours are available as css variables, you will need neutral and background light colours
* Another developer has started building the companies page (/companies), but they have indicated they are not finished and want to refine it further.
